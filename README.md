🌱 Crop Yield Predictor - SDG 2: Zero Hunger

A machine learning web application that predicts crop yields to support Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.

🎯 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict crop yields based on environmental and agricultural factors, helping farmers optimize resources and improve food security.

🚀 Features

- Data Analysis**: Explore crop yield datasets with interactive visualizations
-ML Models**: Train Random Forest and Linear Regression models
-Predictions**: Real-time crop yield predictions based on input parameters
- Ethical Analysis**: Comprehensive discussion of SDG alignment and ethical considerations
